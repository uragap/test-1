So, how do you get the `T` value out of a `Some` variant when you have a value of type `Option<T>` so you can use that value? The `Option<T>` enum has a large number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check them out in [its documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle). Becoming familiar with the methods on `Option<T>` will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.
