The mini-infobar is a Chrome UI component and is not controllable by the site, but can be easily dismissed by the user. Once dismissed by the user, it will not appear again until a sufficient amount of time has passed (currently 3 months). The mini-infobar will appear when the site meets the {a0 href="#criteria"}criteria{/a0}, regardless of whether you {code1}preventDefault(){/code1} on the {code2}beforeinstallprompt{/code2} event or not.
